When you decide to update foundation do the following:
------------------------------------------------------
>Update using Bash on the Foundation Folder(this folder)
>Before updating make sure you back up this folder
>In Bash type the following: foundation update
>Once updated move the relevant files into the Foundation folder
>Make sure that you do not over-write any sass/scss or Javascript changes you may have made to the core files.
>Use Scout to compile your scss to css (this will be dumped into the stylesheet folder, inside the foundation folder.)
